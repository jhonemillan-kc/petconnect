# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Images

Static images for the application (like logos, hero images, etc.) should be placed in the `public` folder. For example, an image located at `public/images/my-image.png` can be referenced in your components as `/images/my-image.png`.
